Data Mining,06-08-21,SAS,https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/data-mining.html,"Data mining is the process of finding anomalies, patterns and correlations within large data sets to predict outcomes. Using a broad range of techniques, you can use this information to increase revenues, cut costs, improve customer relationships, reduce risks and more."
Data Mining,06-08-21,Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining,"Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the ""knowledge discovery in databases"" process or KDD. Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating."
Data Mining,06-08-21,Talend,https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-mining/,"Data mining is the process of analyzing massive volumes of data to discover business intelligence that helps companies solve problems, mitigate risks, and seize new opportunities. "
Data Mining,06-08-21,IBM,https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/data-mining,"Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in data (KDD), is the process of uncovering patterns and other valuable information from large data sets. Given the evolution of data warehousing technology and the growth of big data, adoption of data mining techniques has rapidly accelerated over the last couple of decades, assisting companies by transforming their raw data into useful knowledge."
Data Mining,06-08-21,Investopedia,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/datamining.asp,"Data mining is a process used by companies to turn raw data into useful information. By using software to look for patterns in large batches of data, businesses can learn more about their customers to develop more effective marketing strategies, increase sales and decrease costs. Data mining depends on effective data collection, warehousing, and computer processing."
Data Mining,06-08-21,Encyclopedia Britannica,https://www.britannica.com/technology/data-mining,"Data mining, also called knowledge discovery in databases, in computer science, the process of discovering interesting and useful patterns and relationships in large volumes of data. The field combines tools from statistics and artificial intelligence (such as neural networks and machine learning) with database management to analyze large digital collections, known as data sets. Data mining is widely used in business (insurance, banking, retail), science research (astronomy, medicine), and government security (detection of criminals and terrorists).
The proliferation of numerous large, and sometimes connected, government and private databases has led to regulations to ensure that individual records are accurate and secure from unauthorized viewing or tampering. Most types of data mining are targeted toward ascertaining general knowledge about a group rather than knowledge about specific individuals—a supermarket is less concerned about selling one more item to one person than about selling many items to many people—though pattern analysis also may be used to discern anomalous individual behaviour such as fraud or other criminal activity."
Data Mining,06-08-21,Great Learning,https://www.mygreatlearning.com/academy/learn-for-free/courses/data-mining1,"Data Mining is defined as the procedure of extracting information from huge sets of data. It is one of the most useful techniques that help entrepreneurs, researchers, and individuals to extract valuable information from huge sets of data. This course is about the concepts of Data Mining such as Anomaly detection and Regression Analysis along with the hands-on . The course starts with a basic overview and the terminologies involved in data mining and then gradually moves on to cover topics such as classification, regression, and prediction."
Data Mining,06-08-21,GeeksforGeeks,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-mining/,"In the context of computer science, “Data Mining” refers to the extraction of useful information from a bulk of data or data warehouses. One can see that the term itself is a little bit confusing. In case of coal or diamond mining, the result of extraction process is coal or diamond. But in case of Data Mining, the result of extraction process is not data!! Instead, the result of data mining is the patterns and knowledge that we gain at the end of the extraction process. In that sense, Data Mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery or Knowledge Extraction."
Data Mining,06-08-21,Guru 99,https://www.guru99.com/data-mining-tutorial.html,"Data mining is looking for hidden, valid, and potentially useful patterns in huge data sets. Data Mining is all about discovering unsuspected/ previously unknown relationships amongst the data.
It is a multi-disciplinary skill that uses machine learning, statistics, AI and database technology.
The insights derived via Data Mining can be used for marketing, fraud detection, and scientific discovery, etc.
Data mining is also called as Knowledge discovery, Knowledge extraction, data/pattern analysis, information harvesting, etc."
Data Mining,06-08-21,Tech Target,https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/data-mining,"Data mining is the process of sorting through large data sets to identify patterns and establish relationships to solve problems through data analysis. Data mining tools allow enterprises to predict future trends.
In data mining, association rules are created by analyzing data for frequent if/then patterns, then using the support and confidence criteria to locate the most important relationships within the data"
Data Mining,06-08-21,Oracle,https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/datamine.111/b28129/process.htm#DMCON002,"Data mining is the practice of automatically searching large stores of data to discover patterns and trends that go beyond simple analysis. Data mining uses sophisticated mathematical algorithms to segment the data and evaluate the probability of future events. Data mining is also known as Knowledge Discovery in Data (KDD).
The key properties of data mining are:
Automatic discovery of patterns
Prediction of likely outcomes
Creation of actionable information
Focus on large data sets and databases
Data mining can answer questions that cannot be addressed through simple query and reporting techniques."
Data Mining,06-08-21,Corporate finance institute,https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/data-mining/,"Data mining is the process of uncovering patterns and finding anomalies and relationships in large datasets that can be used to make predictions about future trends. The main purpose of data mining is extracting valuable information from available data.
Data mining is considered an interdisciplinary field that joins the techniques of computer science and statistics. Note that the term “data mining” is a misnomer. It is primarily concerned with discovering patterns and anomalies within datasets, but it is not related to the extraction of the data itself."
Data Mining,06-08-21,Intellipaat,https://intellipaat.com/community/55683/what-is-data-mining-in-data-science,"Data mining is to analyze the data sets to summarize their main characteristics and to gather significant patterns and trends. Data mining is used for extracting useful information from large databases the can assist in making efficient business decisions. Data mining is used in marketing for doing market segmentation, understanding customer behavior, and target with personalized loyalty campaigns. Data Mining is also used in the retail industry for finding the most valuable customers and increasing sales at the checkout queue. It is used in banking for fraud detection and risk analysis. It is also used in healthcare for making more accurate diagnostics."

Data Mining,06-08-21,Techopedia,https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1181/data-mining,"Data mining is the process of analyzing hidden patterns of data according to different perspectives in order to turn that data into useful and often actionable information. Data is collected and assembled in common areas, such as data warehouses, and data mining algorithms look for patterns that businesses can use to make better decisions, such as decisions that help cut costs, increase revenue, or better serve customers or clients.
Data mining is also known as data discovery or knowledge discovery. It's critical in business intelligence to establish data-driven decisions."
