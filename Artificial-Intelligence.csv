Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Sas,https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html,"Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between the former and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as artificial general intelligence (AGI) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called artificial biological intelligence (ABI). Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of ""intelligent agents"": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is often used to describe machines that mimic ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving""."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Talend,https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-artificial-intelligence/,"Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science which enables computer systems to learn and perform tasks normally associated with human intellect, such as speech recognition, decision-making, and visual perception."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,IBM,https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence,"It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Investopedia,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence-ai.asp,"Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Encyclopedia Britannica,https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Great Learning,https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-is-artificial-intelligence/,"The intelligence demonstrated by machines is known as Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence has grown to be very popular in today’s world. It is the simulation of natural intelligence in machines that are programmed to learn and mimic the actions of humans. These machines are able to learn with experience and perform human-like tasks. As technologies such as AI continue to grow, they will have a great impact on our quality of life. It’s but natural that everyone today wants to connect with AI technology somehow, may it be as an end-user or pursuing a career in Artificial Intelligence."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,GeeksforGeeks,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence-an-introduction/,"Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply the knowledge. Knowledge is the information acquired through experience. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure(training). Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural(i.e., human beings) ‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained through exposure.”"
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Guru 99,https://www.guru99.com/artificial-intelligence-tutorial.html,"AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the ability of a machine to perform cognitive functions as humans do, such as perceiving, learning, reasoning and solving problems. The benchmark for AI is the human level concerning in teams of reasoning, speech, and vision."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Tech Target,https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/AI-Artificial-Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition and machine vision.
AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Oracle,https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-ai/,"In the simplest terms, artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. AI manifests in a number of forms. A few examples are:
Chatbots use AI to understand customer problems faster and provide more efficient answers
Intelligent assistants use AI to parse critical information from large free-text datasets to improve scheduling
Recommendation engines can provide automated recommendations for TV shows based on users’ viewing habits
AI is much more about the process and the capability for superpowered thinking and data analysis than it is about any particular format or function. Although AI brings up images of high-functioning, human-like robots taking over the world, AI isn’t intended to replace humans. It’s intended to significantly enhance human capabilities and contributions. That makes it a very valuable business asset."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Corporate finance institute,https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/artificial-intelligence-ai/,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad branch of computer science that is focused on a machine’s capability to produce rational behavior from external inputs. The goal of AI is to create systems that can perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence. AI manifests itself in everyday life via virtual assistants, search prediction technology, and even ride-hailing services."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Intellipaat,https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-artificial-intelligence/#no1,"Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a computer program to learn and think. John McCarthy coined the term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ in the 1950s. He said, ‘Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions, and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.’"
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/artificial_intelligence.htm,"The modern definition of artificial intelligence (or AI) is ""the study and design of intelligent agents"" where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximizes its chances of success."
Artificial Intelligence,06-08-21,Techopedia,https://www.techopedia.com/definition/190/artificial-intelligence-ai,"Artificial intelligence (AI), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that aims to imbue software with the ability to analyze its environment using either predetermined rules and search algorithms, or pattern recognizing machine learning models, and then make decisions based on those analyses."
